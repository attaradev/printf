# C - printf Project

## Description

This is a team project that is part of the one year software engineering intensive training at ALX. This project aims at replicating the printf() function in the C Programming Language, originally created by Dennis Ritchie. The lessons learnt from this project are:

- Collaborating with others using git and GitHub
- Using variadic functions in big projects
- Understanding and utilising the complxities of the printf() function
- Managing various source code files in big projects
- Effective time management
- Identifying suitable workflow for effective project execution

## Function Prototype

`int _printf(const char *format, ...);`

## Usage

- Print a string to the standard output according to format
- Files were created using vim
- All files were compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- The codes comply with [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl), [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- Function can be invoked as: `_printf("format string", args, ...)` where `format string` can contain conversion specifiers, flags, and regular characters
- On success, the function returns the number of characters in the output string or -1 when it fails.
